# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the Project
Assessing credit risk is an important endeavour conducted by orgnaizations before issuing loans to their applicants. The applicant must be evaluated over many different criteria to ensure that they have the ability to pay back the loan in the future. Because of the huge amount of data involved in this process, it is useful to use machine learning models to learn from pre-existing data and develop algorithms that can be applied to future loan applications. As such, this project uses a variety of models from the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to conduct resampling and assess credit risk.

## Results

Six machine learning models were used in this analysis, with an evaluation of each below:
